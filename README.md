# GEN3PokemonDistributions

Equipment Required:
- 2x GBAs
- 1x Link Cable (original cable works, 3rd party cables might not work)
- 1x Distribution cart, so you can use a GBA Flash Card or Emulator
- 1x Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, LeafGreen, FireRed cart from the language of the distribution you are using.

Procedure:
1) Save in a Pokemon center and have at least 1 free slot in your party.
2) Now turn off the receiving system.
3) Turn on the sending system with the distribution cart inside.
4) Connect the link cable between the two GBAs. NOTE: It is important that the master side (often the smaller and purple connector) of the link cable is in the GBA with the distributions cart. If the distribution doesn't send, try to reconnect the link cable the other way around.
5) Turn on the receiving system with the game cart inside and hold start and select as you power the receiving system on. This will make the Nintendo logo disappear. 
6) After a couple seconds you’ll see a colored Nintendo logo appearing on the receiving system and the distribition will then happen automatically.
7) You’ll see a screen that tells you a Pokemon is being received. The distribution is finished once the sprite of the Pokémon has appeared. That Pokemon will now be in your party.
